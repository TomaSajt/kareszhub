    <h2>About Kareszhub</h2>
    <p>
        My original website - tomasajt.github.io - was one of my first websites
        and that's where I made the first version of Karesz Clicker, Karesz
        Clock and eventually KOTW. I found it fun but didn't know what I
        wanted to do <span class="italic">next</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of my friends showed me NextJS, so I started creating the second website, 'kareszhub'.
        I remade some of the original stuff from the previous website, like Karesz Clicker and KOTW.
    </p>
    <p>
        But React's jankiness was a bit too much for KOTW, so I switched to Svelte.
        I was lucky because they had only released SvelteKit that year, and I could create a multi-page site (just like with NextJS).
