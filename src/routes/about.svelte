    <h1>About Kareszhub</h1>
    <p>Kareszhub is a website made by Karesz lovers for Karesz lovers</p>
    <p>Karesz clicker and KOTW were games originally made in Native JS, then NextJS, and now they have been brought over to Svelte</p>
    <p>
        This website was made to migrate some of the old games from React to
        Svelte
    </p>
    <p>The website also houses some extra project I've been working on</p>
